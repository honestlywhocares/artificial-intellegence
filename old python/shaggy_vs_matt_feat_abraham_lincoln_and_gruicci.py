 winspeech.say("Now as I stand in front of you, the brave soldiers that were ready to devote their lives to the cause of the unification of our nation and the freedom of the African Americans. I am fully aware that you have contributed more to this cause then I could ever hope to. One thing I have noticed is that the people refer to me as the great emancipator but this is not true, or rather not complete. Although I have done my part in the emancipation of the slaves, I have by no means done it alone. In fact, by my own hands, I have not freed a single slave. that honor goes to you. ")	
 winspeech.say("The world may not remember our names nor what we said here but it shall never forget what we did out there. Many of you have lost friends and family out there in the battle field. Many of you have seen things that you shall never be able to forget, heard things you will never forget and felt things that you will never forget. Now you may feel that you gave it all in vain but I am here to assure you this is as far from the truth as can be. You have lit the flame of hope into millions of lives and saved a countless number of them.")
 winspeech.say("Now, this is almost certainly not the last of the struggles that we will face. We are bound to face more obstacles. But I and our fellow citizens can rest assured that as long as we have an army as passionate to their cause as you have been we can cross even the most insurmountable of challenges.")
 winspeech.say("Once the dust has settled and the grief is forgotten all of you will be remembered as knights in shining armor. The ones that were willing to lose everything they ever were to love and if need be themselves, but not ready to surrender countless lives into the deep dark depths of slavery. The ones that stared death in its eyes until death itself couldn't stare any longer. Your names may not go down into the history books and 100 years from now few will know who you were but your sacrifice will live in the hearts of every American that will enjoy the privilege of living in this promised land.") 
 winspeech.say("Now it has come time for me to go, go back and speak to the people but to those people, I shall speak about one and only one thing, you and your contributions even the contributions of those who unfortunately couldn't make it to this point. Before I am to go my merry which way I want to tell you one last thing. I have a belief that freedom is not self-evident it is bestowed and you, you have bestowed freedom to every man women or child to live in this land. You stand Behind the smile of every slave child a smile that otherwise wouldâ€™ve never laid upon their cheeks.")
 winspeech.say("Thank You")
